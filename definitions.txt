cell<TAB>the smallest structural unit of an organism
assay<TAB>a laboratory test to measure a substance
vector<TAB>a DNA molecule used to deliver genetic material
bp<TAB>base pair; a fundamental unit in DNA and RNA, consisting of two complementary nitrogenous bases (nucleobases) held together by hydrogen bonds, forming the "rungs" of the double helix structure. In DNA, Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T), and Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C) (A-T, G-C); in RNA, Uracil (U) replaces Thymine (A-U, G-C). These specific pairings are crucial for DNA replication, transcription, and storing genetic information. 
nm<TAB>nanometer; a unit of length for light/atoms
kmer<TAB>A kmer (or k-mer) is a contiguous substring of length k from a biological sequence (DNA, RNA, protein), acting as a fundamental building block in bioinformatics for tasks like genome assembly, species identification, and finding sequence patterns, essentially breaking down long sequences into manageable, fixed-length pieces for analysis. 
mer<TAB>(from Greek meros, meaning "part") is a suffix indicating a repeating unit or subunit in a polymer, like a monomer (one part) or dimer (two parts)
