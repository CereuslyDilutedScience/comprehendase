pathogen<TAB>any organism or biological agent that can cause disease or illness in a host, such as a human, animal, or plant, by invading it, using its resources to multiply, and disrupting normal bodily functions, with common examples including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. These agents, also called infectious agents or germs, trigger an immune response and can spread from host to host, leading to infectious diseases
mastitis<TAB>the inflammation of the mammary gland (breast or udder), often accompanied by infection, characterized by redness, swelling, pain, and warmth, most common in lactating individuals where blocked milk ducts or bacteria can trigger an immune response, leading to fluid buildup and immune cell influx, although it can also occur non-lactating
otitis<TAB>inflammation or infection of the ear, a common condition often caused by viruses or bacteria affecting different ear parts, like the outer ear (otitis externa or swimmer's ear) or the middle ear (otitis media or middle ear infection), which involves fluid buildup and pressure on the eardrum, impacting hearing and requiring medical attention
pneumonia<TAB>an infection and inflammation of the lung's air sacs (alveoli), causing them to fill with fluid or pus, which impairs oxygen absorption. It's triggered by pathogens like bacteria, viruses (e.g., flu, COVID-19), fungi, or parasites, leading to symptoms like cough, fever, chest pain, and difficulty breathing, with severity varying from mild to life-threatening
adhesion<TAB>the attraction between different types of molecules or surfaces, allowing dissimilar substances to stick together, crucial for functions like water transport in plants (adhesion to xylem walls) and cell-to-cell binding via cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) to form tissues, fundamentally important for multicellular life. It contrasts with cohesion (attraction between similar molecules) and involves forces like hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, or electrostatic interactions
invasion<TAB>an organism entering and spreading in a new environment, often causing harm to native species or ecosystems (invasive species), but it also refers to pathogens entering host cells (microbiology) or cancer cells spreading (oncology), all involving breaching barriers to establish and proliferate. It's a key concept in ecology, microbiology, and medicine, describing harmful establishment, spread, and disruption
protein<TAB>a large, complex macromolecule made of one or more long chains of amino acids, folded into specific 3D shapes, that performs critical functions for life, such as providing structure, catalyzing reactions (enzymes), transporting molecules, and acting as hormones or antibodies. Their unique sequence of amino acids, determined by DNA, dictates their structure and function, with functions including cell structure, movement, defense, and regulation.
genome<TAB>the complete set of an organism's genetic material (DNA or RNA), containing all the instructions needed for its development, functioning, reproduction, and evolution, organized into chromosomes within cells. It's the entire blueprint, encompassing both genes (coding sequences) and non-coding regions, providing the fundamental code for building and running that organism
gene<TAB>the basic physical and functional unit of heredity, a specific segment of DNA that carries the instructions for a cell to make proteins or functional RNA molecules. Genes are passed from parents to offspring, influencing traits like eye color and other characteristics. They are organized on chromosomes, and together, all the genes in an organism make up its genome
operon<TAB>a functional unit of DNA in prokaryotes (like bacteria) containing a cluster of related genes, a single promoter, and an operator, allowing them to be transcribed together as one long mRNA molecule and regulated as a single unit, efficiently enabling coordinated gene expression for a specific metabolic pathway, like the lac operon for lactose metabolism
membrane<TAB>a thin, flexible barrier separating a cell or organelle from its environment, primarily made of a lipid bilayer (phospholipids) and proteins, which regulates the passage of substances (semipermeable) and is crucial for cell structure, communication, and internal organization. It keeps harmful things out, lets essential nutrients in, and separates incompatible chemical processes. 
surface<TAB>the crucial interface between an organism (or its parts, like cells, organs) and the external environment, acting as a boundary for shape, protection, and vital material exchange (nutrients in, waste out) through mechanisms like selective transport, often defined by the cell membrane or tissue layer, with its area (surface area) critical for metabolic efficiency, as seen in the surface-area-to-volume ratio
lipid<TAB>a diverse group of water-insoluble organic molecules, including fats, oils, waxes, steroids, and phospholipids, crucial for energy storage, cell membrane structure, signaling (like hormones), insulation, and vitamin absorption. They are characterized by hydrophobic (water-fearing) hydrocarbon chains, though some, like phospholipids, have hydrophilic (water-loving) parts, allowing them to form cell membranes

ribosomal<TAB>essential molecular machines found in all cells that synthesize proteins by translating messenger RNA (mRNA) into specific chains of amino acids, a process called translation. Composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and protein, ribosomes read the genetic code from mRNA and link amino acids together to form polypeptide chains, which then fold into functional proteins vital for cellular structures and functions
subunit<TAB>a fundamental, distinct component that joins with other subunits to form a larger, functional molecular complex, most commonly referring to individual polypeptide chains (subunits) that assemble into a complete protein complex (like hemoglobin or ribosomes) or monomeric units (like nucleotides in DNA/RNA) that build polymers. These subunits can be identical (like in hemoglobin's alpha/beta chains) or different (like regulatory vs. catalytic subunits in enzymes) and define a protein's quaternary structure
replication<TAB>the fundamental process where a cell makes an exact copy of its DNA, ensuring that each new daughter cell receives identical genetic information during cell division, crucial for growth, repair, and inheritance, involving enzymes unwinding the DNA and building complementary strands. This semi-conservative process uses each original strand as a template, resulting in two new DNA molecules, each with one old and one new strand. 
transcription<TAB>the essential first step of gene expression where a cell creates a complementary RNA copy (messenger RNA or mRNA) from a segment of DNA, essentially rewriting the genetic code from DNA to RNA to carry instructions for building proteins or other functional RNA molecules. This process involves RNA polymerase unwinding DNA, reading one strand as a template, and building a new RNA strand using base pairing rules, moving from the DNA's 3' to 5' direction to synthesize RNA 5' to 3'
translation<TAB>the fundamental process where a cell synthesizes proteins by decoding messenger RNA (mRNA) into a specific sequence of amino acids, forming a polypeptide chain that eventually becomes a functional protein, a key part of the central dogma (DNA → RNA → Protein). This occurs on ribosomes, using transfer RNA (tRNA) to match three-base mRNA "codons" to specific amino acids, a process crucial for building and operating the cell.
